    <h1><b><br>Initiatives</br>
        As an NGO for children in the Philippines, we believe that street children are created in the image
        of the Supreme Being with inherent worth and dignity. Therefore, they have the right to live and be
        protected from any form of abuse. They should be given opportunities to express themselves and maximize
        their potentials to help themselves and others. We envision a Philippines where urban poor children can
        gain access to the fulfillment of their rights especially children in street situations.<br>Involvements</br>

        Families and Homeless Youth<br>Activities and Participation<br>The Street Education and Protection (STEP) Program
        Childhope Philippines actively responds to the call on how to help the street children and youth through its Street Education and Protection (STEP) Program. Guided by the Caring-Healing-Teaching framework, the STEP Program has 4 major components. We put the best interest 
        of the child at the center of the program and their holistic development as our main goal. 
        The KalyEskwela literally translates to “school on the streets.” This part of the program uses a mobile van with 
        audiovisual equipment to conduct alternative education sessions and basic literacy and numeracy classes. Under the
        DepEd-accredited Alternative Learning System (ALS), street children and youth learn through modules 
        guided by our street educators trained as instructional managers.  <b></h1>
